Description of business logic

## ACL

There are three login types:

- Customer
- Train drivers
- Repairmen
- Department managers
- Finances
- System operators


Customers can book tickets.

Train drivers can create train services (i.e. starting a ride), view routes, create "service" type delays.

Repairmen can create train inspection.

Department managers do management of departments and brigades.

Finances have full view on tickets and can adjust prices, create delays.

System operators can do everything.
